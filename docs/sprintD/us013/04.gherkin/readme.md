## 04. Gherkin

This folder is dedicated to Gherkin syntax for writing behavior-driven development (BDD) tests. Gherkin allows us to write tests in a way that is readable and understandable by everyone on the team, including non-technical members.

**Note**: The actual Gherkin tests and acceptance tests for US 013 are maintained in a separate repository to streamline our development process and manage versions more effectively. 

For detailed test scenarios and acceptance criteria for US 013 - Delete user, please refer to:
