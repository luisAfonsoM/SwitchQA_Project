## Introduction

 In this sprint, we were focused on improving the user experience by addressing bugs and discrepancies between our application's front-end and back-end. To track our progress effectively, we have introduced the "BuggedStories.md" file in our repository, listing user stories with bugs sorted by their impact on user experience. We also created dedicated "Bugs" sections for each user story, describing the encountered issues and linking them to acceptance criteria violations. To visualize these interactions, we made a sequence diagram for each bugged user story. After completing these tasks, we worked on resolving the identified issues to enhance our application's reliability.

## BuggedStories.md Overview

  In our project's documentation repository, we have created a file named "BuggedStories.md." This file contains a compilation of links to every user story that has encountered issues. The list is organized based on the impact of these bugs on the user experience (UIX), with the user stories that have the most substantial influence on user interaction positioned at the top of the list. We progressively list those with a lesser impact towards the bottom. This organization helps our focus on addressing the most critical issues first.
