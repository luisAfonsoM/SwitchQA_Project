**Goal:** The primary objective was to meticulously outline and specify the existing functionalities within the system, ensuring a comprehensive understanding and documentation of each functionality.

**Status:** Through analysis and collaboration, the team successfully identified and documented all functionalities, establishing a robust foundation for future sprints and developments.


### Sprint B/2:
[Presentation Index](../sprintB/presentation/presentation.index.md)

**Goal:** This sprint's aim was to produce API tests that rigorously examine and validate the existing functionalities, thereby fortifying the system against potential vulnerabilities.

**Status:** All existing functionalities underwent rigorous testing using unit tests, ensuring their stability and reliability in various scenarios.


### Sprint C/3:
[Presentation Index](../sprintC/presentation.index.md)

**Goal:** Focused on elevating the user experience, this sprint aimed at enhancing the system by resolving bugs, aligning the app's front-end and back-end components, and enhancing overall reliability.

**Status:** The team successfully addressed and rectified all reported bugs, significantly improving the system's stability and usability. However, a specific functionality, us07 - voting on a post, remained unresolved due to a lack of expertise among team members at that time.

### Sprint D/4:
[Presentation Index](../sprintD/presentation/presentation.index.md)

**Goal:**  This sprint encompassed various enhancements, including adding post sorting, updating user profiles, establishing coding standards with tools like Prettier and Tsdoc, backend and frontend adjustments, comprehensive documentation of User Stories, and the creation of backend tests, all while leveraging the efficiency of pair-programming.

**Status:** Collaborating in pair-programming groups, the team successfully fulfilled all outlined requests, ensuring the incorporation of new features, adherence to coding standards, and comprehensive documentation.

### Sprint E/5:
[Presentation Index](../sprintE/presentation/presentation.index.md)

**Goal:** Aiming for comprehensive testing and user-oriented development, this sprint aimed to develop acceptance tests for previous user stories, automate front-end tests using Gherkin and WebdriverIO, create user stories for the statistics page, align unit tests with AAA principles, and emphasize a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) approach.

**Status:** Everything has been completed according to the outlined goals, except for the user story: "As a Member, I want to know the hour of the day when there are more posts for a specific day, but due to insufficient group members, this feature hasn't been implemented yet.

### Sprint F/6:
[Presentation Index](../sprintF/presentation/presentation.index.md)

**Goal:** This sprint's goals were to comprehensively address user story documentation, rectify past errors, seamlessly integrate new functionalities, ensure strict compliance with non-functional requirements, and initiate cross-evaluation and defect assessment across projects, setting the stage for upcoming implementation and evaluation phases.

**Status:** All outlined objectives were successfully achieved: a comprehensive completion of user story documentation, rectification of past errors, seamless integration of new functionalities, strict compliance with non-functional requirements, and initiation of cross-evaluation and defect assessment across projects.

### Sprint G/7:
[Presentation Index](../sprintG/readme.md)

**Goal:** In this final sprint, a comprehensive report encompassing all sprints was requested. It should include progress updates on user stories, their documentation, and tests. Additionally, the report should detail a plan to rectify any incomplete or erroneous elements from prior sprints and the selection and integration of new functionalities. Compliance with non-functional requirements, such as enforcing code complexity limitations through ESLint and reporting any code or test smells, is also essential.

**Status:** User story documentation has been successfully addressed, with rectification of some past errors and an attempted integration of new functionality. ESLint has been executed across the project to enforce coding standards. Preparation has been made for forthcoming cross-evaluation and defect assessment across projects, setting the stage for comprehensive evaluation by other groups.
